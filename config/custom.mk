# custom.mk
#
# This file defines the sources used to drive the 'custom' build.
#
# Override this to use your own development versions
# Each package needs a PREFIX_NAME, PREFIX_VERSION, and PREFIX_URL set
# As well as a PREFIX_DLTYPE to specify the source type.
# Valid dl types are: TGZ, BZ2, GZ, GIT, and DIR.
# The last directly uses the specified source tree, symlinking
# it into the appropriate build directory.
